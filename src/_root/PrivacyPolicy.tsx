        <h2 className="">Your Privacy & Rights Matter</h2>
        <p>
        We take your privacy and digital ownership seriously. Whether you're trading, holding, or interacting with crypto assets through our platform, here are the core principles you should know.

        Ownership in the crypto world is defined by control of private keys. If you control the keys, you control the asset—simple as that. When you acquire crypto through our platform or any trusted source, your ownership is recorded transparently on the blockchain. That’s your proof—no middleman required.

        A crypto trading platform is a secure environment where users can buy, sell, or swap digital currencies. These platforms log transactions on a decentralized ledger (aka the blockchain), ensuring that all trades are verifiable, transparent, and tamper-proof.
